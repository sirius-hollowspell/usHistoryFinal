            <p>Traditionally, the spouse of the President served as the hostess and was in charge of all things domestic; but that role has evolved. First Ladies were often the most famous women in America, and were able to influence, or at least were perceived to be able to influence, the President. Due to their position and proximity, proponents of causes would implore First Ladies for their aid and assistance, sometimes successful in finding a champion. 20th century First Ladies sponsored national and international causes such as environmentalism, volunteerism, womenâ€™s rights, literacy, and treatment for drug dependency.</p>
